# Self-Organizing-Maps-on-Covid-Data

## Description
Applied Self Organizing Maps (SOM) on COVID19 dataset, to build an effective visualization of the data. 
Each color in SOM represents a cluster and its varying shades denotes nearby/similar clusters. The representative color of each country is then used to color that country on the world map. 
Results are displayed in the notebook attached.
